		<h1>Site Blocked - Access Denied</h1>
		
		<p>This site has been deemed in violation of the NoNews blacklist.</p>
		
		<h3>Why is this page being blocked?</h3>
		
		<p>The purpose of the NoNews extension is to block websites that are known news media outlets, or sites with the primary purpose of linking to known news media outlets.  NoNews seeks to preserve your happiness by keeping the news out of your casual browsing sessions.</p>
		
		<h3>Still want to view this page?</h3>
		
		<p>You still have options:</p>
		
		<uL>
			<li>Remove this site from the blacklist via the options page (coming soon!).</li>
			<li>Temporarily disable NoNews for 15 minutes (coming soon!).</li>
			<li>View the site in <a href="http://support.google.com/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=95464" target="_top">incognito mode</a>, bypassing this filter.</li>
			<li><a href="disable-extension.html">Disable the NoNews extension</a> and go back to your old ways.</li>

		<h3>Remind me, why is "the news" so bad?</h3>
		
		<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz" target="_top">Aaron Swartz</a> sums it up nicely in this excerpt from his essay <em><a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/hatethenews" target="_top">I Hate the News</a></em>:</p>
		
		<blockquote>
			The newsâ€™s obsession with having a little bit of information on a wide variety of subjects means that it actually gets most of those subjects wrong. (One need only read the blatant errors reported in the corrections page to get some sense of the more thorough-going errors that must lie beneath them. And, indeed, anyone who has ever been in the news will tell you that the news always gets the story wrong.) Its obsession with the criminal and the deviant makes us less trusting people. Its obsession with the hurry of the day-to-day makes us less reflective thinkers. Its obsession with surfaces makes us shallow.
